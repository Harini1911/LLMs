### What are LLMs?

- Large Language Models are deep learning models trained on huge datasets to understand human languages.
- Large Language Models learn the patterns and relationships between the words in the language. 
    - For example, it understands the syntactic and semantic structure of the language like grammar, order of the words, and meaning of the words and phrases. It gains the capability to grasp the whole language itself.

### How exactly is language models different from Large Language Models?

- Same : learn and understand the human language 
- Difference : Development of these models.
    - Language models are generally statistical models developed using HMMs or probabilistic-based models whereas Large Language Models are deep learning models with billions of parameters trained on a very huge dataset.

### Why Large Language Models?
- LLMs are task-agnostic models.
- Task-agnostic refers to an approach or method that is not specifically designed or optimized for a particular task. Instead, it is intended to be general-purpose and applicable to a wide range of tasks.

### Different Types of LLMs
- Continuing the text
    - These LLMs are trained to predict the next sequence of words in the input text. Their task at hand is to continue the text.
- Dialogue optimized
    - These LLMs respond back with an answer rather than completing it. 
        - Given the input “How are you?”, these LLMs might respond back with an answer “I am doing fine.” rather than completing the sentence.
